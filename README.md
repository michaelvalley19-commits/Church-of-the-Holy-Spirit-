  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    The Holy Spirit is God fellowship, is a faith centered on the understanding that, the Holy Spirit is God. That the Holy Spirit descended upon and entered Jesus at Baptism. That the Holy Spirit preform the miracles and spoke to the people through Jesus
Christ, by dwelling within Him.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe that the Holy Spirit spoke with wisdome and authority to the people, We believe that the very love we perceived from Jesus, was actually coming from God, the Holy Spirit and not Jesus Christ.

  <h2>Jesus explains that the Father speaks the words and the Father doeth the Work, in the Conversation with Philip</h2>

  <blockquote>
    “Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
    The very words that I speak unto you I speak not of my own:
    but the Father that dwelleth in me, he speaks the words and He  doth the works.”
    <br/>
    <strong>— John 14:10 (KJV)</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    When Philip asked Jesus to show them the Father, the very question reveals
    that the disciples understood  God was inside of Jesus somehow but didn't know how. Nonetheless, Jesus clarified that the very words He spoke were not His own, but the words of the Father dwelling in Him.

  <h2>“Before Abraham Was, I AM”</h2>

  <blockquote>
    “Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
    Before Abraham was, I AM.”
    <br/>
    <strong>— John 8:58 (KJV)</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    We understand this statement as the Holy Spirit—God Himself—speaking from within Jesus. Jesus, as a man, was not alive before Abraham; rather, it was God, who has always existed, declaring His eternal presence from within Jesus.
  </p>

    <blockquote>
      “And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water:
      and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God
      descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.”
      <br/>
      <strong>— Matthew 3:16 (KJV)</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      From that moment forward, Jesus spoke the words of God and performed the
      works of God through the indwelling Holy Spirit.
