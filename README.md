To unravel the confusion, and lead men and women into the Kingdom of Heaven, the man of God would have to be an Attorney as to Law. He must know! As a man of God, I personally am not perfect.  It's hard for me to get along with people because I can see sin. That being said, I give you my Word, that everything I'm telling you is Biblical and true. I search the scripture and get confirmationfrom God. God be with you.
