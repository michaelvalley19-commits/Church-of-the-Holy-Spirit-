  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    The Spirit is God Fellowship is a faith community centered on the belief
    that the Holy Spirit is God and that God worked and spoke through Jesus
    Christ by dwelling within Him.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe that the Holy Spirit entered Jesus at His baptism, empowering
    Him to speak God’s words and perform God’s works—not by His own authority,
    but by the Father who dwelt within Him.
  </p>

  <h2>Jesus and the Father: The Conversation with Philip</h2>

  <blockquote>
    “Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
    The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself:
    but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.”
    <br/>
    <strong>— John 14:10 (KJV)</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    When Philip asked Jesus to show them the Father, the question itself reveals
    that the disciples understood God was somehow within Jesus, yet they did not
    fully understand how. Jesus clarified that the words He spoke were not His
    own, but the words of the Father dwelling in Him.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>“Before Abraham Was, I AM”</h2>

  <blockquote>
    “Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
    Before Abraham was, I am.”
    <br/>
    <strong>— John 8:58 (KJV)</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    We understand this statement as the Holy Spirit—God Himself—speaking from
    within Jesus. Jesus, as a man, was not alive before Abraham; rather, it was
    God, who has always existed, declaring His eternal presence from within Him.
  </p>

  <h2>The Baptism of Jesus</h2>

    <p>
      At the baptism of Jesus, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, marking the
      moment when God entered and empowered Him to begin His ministry.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water:
      and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God
      descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.”
      <br/>
      <strong>— Matthew 3:16 (KJV)</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      From that moment forward, Jesus spoke the words of God and performed the
      works of God through the indwelling Holy Spirit.
