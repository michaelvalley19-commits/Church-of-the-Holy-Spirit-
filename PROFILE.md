    “Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
    The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself:
    but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.”
    <br/>
    <strong>— John 14:10 (KJV)</strong>

    When Philip asked Jesus to show them the Father, the very question reveals that the disciples understood that God was inside of  Jesus somehow but didn't know how. Jesus clarified that the very words he spoke were not his, but the Father dwelling in Him. He spoke the words and did the work.

      At the baptism of Jesus, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, marking the moment when God entered Him to begin His ministry.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water:
      and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God
      descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.”
      <br/>
      <strong>— Matthew 3:16 (KJV)</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      From that moment forward, Jesus spoke the words of God and performed the
      works of God through the indwelling Holy Spirit.
