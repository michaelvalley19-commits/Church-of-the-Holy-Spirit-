    <h1>The Holy Spirit is God!</h1>
    <p>For over 2000 years the Church has taught the Word of God completely wrong. This started when the Romans took over the Hebrew religion, they declared Jesus as God in the flesh, but that isn't the faith of the Hebrew people. Nonetheless,they would go on to argue about the nature of Jesus Christ and God. Something they knew nothing about.The argument was historic, recorded at the Counsel of Nicaea 325 AD. Athansis won the argument and declared Jesus was God in the flesh, creating a single scripture and embedded it within the Bible, John 1:1. 

However, that isn't the story line of the Bible. The original story line of the Bible is John 3:16. Not only that, the concept of God and Jesus Christ is wrong. For an example, we know that the angel Gabriel told Mary that the Holy Spirit will come to her and His power will over shadow her. In this scenario, the Holy Spirit is the Father of Jesus Christ.

      <h2>How People Misunderstand God</h2>
      <p>
There is so much more to the Gospel that pastors and preachers are not telling people. I honestly don't think they really know God or the scriptures. If they did, we would all get together and resolve many of the problems we have today. Remember, church of God isn't just preaching. His job is taking care of his sheep. Please consider this as proof that the church is teaching the Word of God Wrong. 
        In this episode, Jesus was already baptized and had received the Holy Spirit unto Himself.
        In this scene, the Spirit was inside of Jesus, telling the disciples about the future and
        the Day of Judgment.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven,
        but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven…”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Here, the Holy Spirit is speaking to the believer. This sounds like pastors and preachers! To try to correct the matter, the pastors and preachers need to preach that it was the Holy Spirit who spoke with authority and healed the people. This is the proper way of teaching. Jesus never said to pray to him. He said to pray to the Father. Maybe people get this confused with Jesus saying, you can ask God anything in my name and it will be done for you. Still, all power comes from the Holy Spirit.

      <h2>The Difference Between Jesus and God</h2>
      <p>
        This is important, but I'm going to tell you the best way that I can. The love you have for Jesus is actually the love you have for the Holy Spirit. 
        The Holy Spirit entered Jesus at his baptism and that was who was inside of Jesus that healed the people and giving His love freely.
        That is who you fell in love with, but becauseyou see Jesus, you think it's Jesus. Let me show you the difference between Jesus and God, personality wise.

      <h2>The Crying Woman</h2>
      <p>
        In this episode, God the Holy Spirit was not present, not inside of Jesus. Here, the healing was different, it took about an hour for it to manifest. However, this scene revealed the human nature of Jesus.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Matthew 15:22–28
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Jesus initially refused her the gift of God saying, it was not right to give the children’s bread to dogs.
        This shows the human mindset of Jesus at that time. I'm sure it's changed by now but Jesus is human and in those days the Jews looked down in the other people. This is the human Jesus.

      <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>
      <p>
        On the other hand, when God was inside of Jesus, it's written that he was filled with light. All people had to do was touch Him and they were healed.No questions asked, only one. When the woman was healed, God asked, " Who touched me?". That was the Holy Spirit talking, healing people, giving His love freely. That’s the Holy Spirit who loves you. He gave His son for you! He wants you to understand that it was Him! He's the one.  When the Spirit prophesied that they would be crying after the Lord, when it was Him that did everything. They didn’t know God, or the scriptures. This is why He said,  "I never knew you."

      <h2>Understanding the Truth</h2>
      <p>
        It will be hard for someone to take this in. It will take time but think about what I'm telling you. It was the Holy Spirit who taught with authority, healed the sick, and fed the thousands. Please look at the conversation Jesus had with Philip.  Philip asked Jesus,  "Show us the Father and it will satisfy us." That very question should tell you that they knew God was inside of Jesus but didn't know how.  Nonetheless, Jesus tells Philip, "The very words I speak are not of my own, but the Father who dwells inside of me, He doeth the works." Jesus is trying his best to describe how God, the Holy Spirit was inside of him. 
        In short, everything you read about Jesus should be understood as the Holy Spirit working through Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Jesus too, but it is the Holy Spirit who created the Heavens, Earth and everything so we can be happy. He loves you freely and He wants you to understand that it was Him so that you can love Him.
