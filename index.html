      <h2>How People Misunderstand God</h2>
      <p>
        In this episode, Jesus was already baptized and had received the Holy Spirit unto Himself.
        In this scene, the Spirit was inside of Jesus, telling the disciples about the future and
        the Day of Judgment.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven,
        but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven…”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        We know it was the Holy Spirit speaking because He prophesied about the Day of Judgment.
        The people would cry, “Lord, Lord,” but it would be God who answered the door.

      <h2>The Difference Between Jesus and God</h2>
      <p>
        This is importantto understand, the love you have for Jesus is actually the love you have for God.
        It was the Holy Spirit inside of Jesus healing the people and giving His love freely.
        That is who people fell in love with. Let me show you the difference between Jesus and God, personality wise.

      <h2>The Crying Woman</h2>
      <p>
        In this episode, God was not present inside of Jesus. The healing was different, it took about an hour for it to manifest. However, this scene revealed the human nature of Jesus.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Matthew 15:22–28
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Jesus initially refused her the gift of God saying it was not right to give the children’s bread to dogs.
        This shows the human mindset of Jesus at that time.

      <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>
      <p>
        On the other hand, when God was inside of Jesus, all people had to do was touch Him and they were healed.
        No questions. This was the Holy Spirit giving His love freely.

      <h2>Understanding the Truth</h2>
      <p>
        It was the Holy Spirit who taught with authority, healed the sick, and fed the thousands.
        Everything you read about Jesus should be understood as the Holy Spirit working through Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Jesus too, but it is the Holy Spirit who loves you freely.
