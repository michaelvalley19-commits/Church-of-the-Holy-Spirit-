    <h1>The Holy Spirit is God!</h1>
    <p>For over 2000 years the Church has taught the Word of God completely wrong. This started when the Romans took over the Hebrew religion. They declared Jesus as God in the flesh, but that wasn't the faith of the Hebrew people. Nonetheless,they would go on to argue about the nature of Jesus Christ and God. The argument was historic, recorded at the Counsel of Nicaea 325 AD.- Fast-forward: Athansis won that argument and declared Jesus as God in the flesh! They created a single scripture and embedded it within the Bible, John 1:1. 

However, that isn't the story line of the Bible. The Church changed a scripture here and there, but they couldn't distroy the concept of the holy scriptures. The original story line of the Bible, and the original concept is John 3:16. "For God so loved thw world." He gave His son as a sacrifice for our sins! And this is the faith of Gods people. 
      The concept of God and Jesus, is a Father and Son relationship. There is no such thing as the Trinity. It's only the Father and the Son. For an example, we know that the angel Gabriel told Mary:
      "And the angel Gabriel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God." Luke 1:35
      In this scenario, the Holy Spirit is the Father of Jesus Christ! 
      I really believe that it's to keep you from God, but that's my opinion.

      <h2>How People Misunderstand God</h2>
      <p>
There are so many things that pastors and preachers are not teaching the people. I honestly don't think they really know God or the scripture. It seems that they would rather follow the teachings of men than God. Otherwise you would think that they would have gotten it by now, and understand that it is the Holy Spirit that needs to be worshipped. If they did, they would see my point of view and reverse course! We would then get together, and resolve many of the problems people have today. Remember, the church of God isn't just preaching. It's the pastors job to make sure everyone is taken care of, but the role is erversed. 
        Please consider my teachings of God and his son Jesus: 
        In this episode, Jesus was already baptized and had received the Holy Spirit into Himself.
        In this scene, the Spirit was inside of Jesus, telling the disciples about the future, that Day of Judgment. The Holy Spirit said through Jesus Christ:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Here, the Holy Spirit is talking about the pastors and preachers! These will be the ones  who didn't preach the Word of God correctly or didn't know God. 
        Right now, everyone is preaching Jesus, the pastors and preachers really need to preach the Holy Spirit! It was the Holy Spirit who spoke with authority,  healed the people and fed the thousands. This is the proper way of teaching. To confirm this, Jesus never said to pray to him. Jesus said to pray to the Father, "Our Father who art in Heaven." Maybe people are confused with Jesus saying, you can ask God anything in my name and it will be done for you. Still, all power comes from the Holy Spirit.

      <h2>The Difference Between Jesus and God</h2>
      <p>
        This is important, and I'm going to explain this the best way that I can. - The love you have for Jesus is actually the love you have for the Holy Spirit. You love Jesus because he did all that good stuff, right? Well, it was actually the Holy Spirit who did all that good stuff!
        The Holy Spirit entered Jesus at his baptism, and that was who was inside of Jesus that healed the people and giving His love freely. Jesus Christ Baptism:
        "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. 17 And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.” Matthew 3:13-17 KJV
        God entered Jesus and gave His power freely. That is who you fell in love with, but because everyone has been taught to pray to Jesus and love Jesus, that's why God hasn't returned yet. Everyone is worshipping the sacrifice. That means they don't know who God is and how to worship Him. To give you an idea of the difference between Jesus and God, let me show you the difference between their personalities.

      <h2>The Crying Woman</h2>
      <p>
        In this episode, God the Holy Spirit was not present, He was not inside of Jesus at this moment. This can be discerned due to the fact that the healing was different, it took about an hour for it to manifest. In this scene, it revealed the human nature of Jesus Christ and his thought process.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Matthew 15:22–28
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        At first, Jesus, initially refused her the gift of God saying, it was not right to give the children’s bread to the dogs.
        This shows the human mindset of Jesus at that time. I'm not trying to put my Lord down, and I'm sure he's changed his mind by now. Nonetheless, in those days the Jews looked down on the other people.  That's how they thought. This is the human Jesus, he looked down on that woman. Don't be confused with God. God, the Holy Spirit is the one who said that He does not regard the person of a man, not Jesus.

      <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>
      <p>
        On the other hand, when God was inside of Jesus, it's written that he was filled with light. All people had to do was touch Him and they were healed.No questions asked, only one. When the woman was healed, God asked, " Who touched me?". That was the Holy Spirit talking, healing people, giving His love freely. That’s the Holy Spirit who loves you. He gave His son for you! He wants you to understand that it was Him! He's the one.  The Spirit prophesied that they would be crying after the Lord, Lord,  when it was Him that did everything. They didn’t know God, or the scriptures. This's why He said,  "I never knew you; to the pastors and preachers."

      <h2>Understanding the Truth</h2>
      <p>
        It will be hard to digest. It will take time but think about what I'm telling you. It was the Holy Spirit who taught with authority, healed the sick, and fed the thousands. Please look at the conversation Jesus had with Philip.  Philip asked Jesus,  "Show us the Father and it will satisfy us." That very question should tell you that they knew God was inside of Jesus but didn't know how.  Nonetheless, Jesus tells Philip, "The very words I speak are not of my own, but the Father who dwells inside of me, He doeth the works." Jesus is trying his best to describe how God, the Holy Spirit was inside of him. 
        In short, everything you read about Jesus should be understood as the Holy Spirit working through Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Jesus too, but it is the Holy Spirit who created the Heavens, Earth and everything so we can be happy. He loves you freely and He wants you to understand that it was Him so that you can love Him.
        My friends, if you know in your heart that I'm right, please donate. This will help the kingdom of God. Thank you.
