      <h2>How People Misunderstand God</h2>
      <p>
        In this episode, Jesus was already baptized and had received the Holy Spirit unto Himself.
        In this scene, the Spirit was inside of Jesus, telling the disciples about the future and
        the Day of Judgment.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven,
        but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven…”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Here, the Holy Spirit speaking and He prophesied about the Day of Judgment. He said, 
        that the people would cry, “Lord, Lord,” but it would be God who answered the door.

      <h2>The Difference Between Jesus and God</h2>
      <p>
        This is important, but I'm going to tell you in plain English, the love you have for Jesus is actually the love you have for God.
        What I'm saying is, it was the Holy Spirit that was inside of Jesus that healed the people and giving His love freely.
        That is who you fell in love with, but becauseyou see Jesus, you think it'sJesus. Let me show you the difference between Jesus and God, personality wise.

      <h2>The Crying Woman</h2>
      <p>
        In this episode, God the Holy Spirit was not present, not inside of Jesus. Here, the healing was different, it took about an hour for it to manifest. However, this scene revealed the human nature of Jesus.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Matthew 15:22–28
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Jesus initially refused her the gift of God saying, it was not right to give the children’s bread to dogs.
        This shows the human mindset of Jesus at that time. I'm sure it's changed by now but Jesus is human and in those days the Jews looked down in the other people. This is the human Jesus.

      <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>
      <p>
        On the other hand, when God was inside of Jesus, it's written that he was filled with light. All people had to do was touch Him and they were healed.No questions asked, only one. When the woman was healed, God asked, " Who touched me?". That was the Holy Spirit talking, healing people, giving His love freely. That’s the Holy Spirit who loves you. He gave His son for you! He wants you to understand that it was Him! He's the one.  When the Spirit prophesied that they would be crying after the Lord, when it was Him that did everything. They didn’t know God, or the scriptures. This is why He said,  "I never knew you."

      <h2>Understanding the Truth</h2>
      <p>
        It will be hard for someone to take this in. It will take time but think about what I'm telling you. It was the Holy Spirit who taught with authority, healed the sick, and fed the thousands. Please look at the conversation Jesus had with Philip.  Philip asked Jesus,  "Show us the Father and it will satisfy us." That very question should tell you that they knew God was inside of Jesus but didn't know how.  Nonetheless, Jesus tells Philip, "The very words I speak are not of my own, but the Father who dwells inside of me, He doeth the works." Jesus is trying his best to describe how God, the Holy Spirit was inside of him. 
        In short, everything you read about Jesus should be understood as the Holy Spirit working through Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Jesus too, but it is the Holy Spirit who created the Heavens, Earth and everything so we can be happy. He loves you freely and He wants you to understand that it was Him so that you can love Him.
