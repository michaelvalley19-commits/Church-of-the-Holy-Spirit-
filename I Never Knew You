    <h1>How People Misunderstand God</h1>
    <p>A teaching on Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and divine authority</p>
  </header>  <main>
    <section>
      <p>
        In this episode, Jesus was already baptized and had received the Holy Spirit (God) unto himself.
        In this scene, the Spirit was inside of Jesus, telling the disciples about the future and
        the Day of Judgment.
      </p><blockquote>
    “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven,
    but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven…”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Here, we can see that it was the Holy Spirit speaking, because He prophesied about the Day of Judgment.
    Nonetheless, the people will cry, “Lord, Lord,”, not knowing that it was the Holy Spirit who was speaking to them all that time.

  <h2>The Difference Between Jesus and God</h2>
  <p>
    This is very important, the love you have for Jesus is actually the love you have for God! It's like if you got catfished by God, but God wasn’ttryingto pretend to be anyone. He was using the holy body of Jesus to speak to the people. That's the best way I can explain it.
    
    It was the Holy Spirit inside of Jesus healing the people and giving His love freely.
    That is who people fell in love with. We have a testimony from Philip, that Jesus stated that the very words he spoke were not his, but the Father who dwelled in him, He did the work. Let me show you who Jesus is and who God is.

  <h2>The Crying Woman</h2>
  <p>
    In this episode, God was not present inside of Jesus. The healing was different and took about an hour to manifest. However, this scene revealed the human nature of Jesus.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    </p>    <blockquote>     Matthew 15:22–28   </blockquote>    <p>     Jesus initially refused her, saying it was not right to give the children’s bread to dogs. This shows the human mindset of Jesus at that time.   </p> </section>  <section>   <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>   <p> On the ither hand, when God was inside of Jesus, all people had to do was touch Jesus and they were healed. God let them touch him, insomuch that they practically tackled him. That is when the disciples started to protect Him. But God gave freely, no questions. This was the Holy Spirit giving His love freely.   </p> </section>  <section class="children-bg">   <h2>Understanding the Truth</h2>   <p>     To recap, it was the Holy Spirit who taught with authority, healed the sick, and fed the thousands.     Everything you read about Jesus should be understood as the Holy Spirit working through Him.   </p>   <p>     I love Jesus too, but it's the Holy Spirit who loves you! He gave His son as a sacrifice for you.   </p> </section> `
